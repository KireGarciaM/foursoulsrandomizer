        <h1>Custom Booster Packs</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> These booster packs are cards I include in playset with my buddies. Below you will find the many multiple packs I have included in this sites'
          Card Repository. Some Cards sets are originally from other authors' custom pack. I will include thier links and cards whereever they are avaliable.
          Some cards were created by me and my friends during our playthroughs.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          This expansion contains cards with characters from pokemon. These were all handcrafted by me as an effort to expand upon Ezim's Familiars concepts
          introduced in his "Unknown Depths" Expansion. This expansion contains items to help power up pokemon you control and loot that helps catch and power
          up pokemon you have. This expansion also includes many characters from the games that you can play as (mostly taking inspiration from Pokemon Masters EX).
          This is one of my ongoing projects so expect more pokemon and trainers (monsters and characters) added, as well as more items and loot. 

          <h3>Contents</h3>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          This expansion contains cards with characters from The Elder Scrolls Universe. These were all handcrafted by me as an effort to expand my skills on custom cards and add more 
          companions introduced by Ezim in his "Four Souls: Evolved" Expansion. This expansion contains items and loot from the Elder Scrolls universe to help power up the player such 
          as Sweetrolls and Mehrunes Dagger. This expansion also includes characters from the games that you can play as (Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim) as well as monsters from the 
          Elders Scrolls Universe such as Alduin, Dagoth Ur and Molag Bal. This is one of my ongoing projects so expect more loot, items and monsters to be added.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          This expansion contains cards that have a vibe closer to the original Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Cards. These cards are all custom and are added to my real life play set. These cards are
          a culmination of many different custom sets from different card authors. Many from which stem from Mitboy's Mitpack, Basement Dwellers' Basement Expansion, Pixelo's Absolution, squirrelbomber0's Community Food Pack
          , Düpsy's D.E.C.K Pack, and  Crossroadsts' Maestro Media Meta Pack and many more. More information on which card authors are included will be in the credits.
